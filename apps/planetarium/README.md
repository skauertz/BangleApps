# Planetarium

This planetarium takes your position and time and plots the sky as it is.

No planets, or moon, only stars. It can show the 350 most brilliant stars in the sky. 

Plan is to show also constellations, but this is work in progress. Now it shows Taurus and Orion as examples.

I think code is quite optimized already. It runs as fast as I could make it run. If someone has some ideas to speed it up, I could plot more stars.

Basic equations to compute declination and right ascension for stars where taken from this [github repo](https://github.com/Michi83/planetarium).
